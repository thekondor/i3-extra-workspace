# i3-extra-workspace

Tool to create and navigate to an extra supplementary (against focused one) workspace.

```
# '2:work' is a focused workspace 
$ i3-extra-workspace toggle
# '_2:work' is a focused workspace now

$ i3-extra-workspace toggle
# '2:work' is a focused workspace now
```

## Rationale

Instead of having a complex and composite layout (e.g. tabbed), that could be convenient to have a workspace with related containers which are not required right away or used not often (e.g. set of containers with documentation). An extra workspace with almost same name could come to the rescue.

## Usage

Build:

```
$ go install github.com/thekondor/i3-extra-workspace@latest
```

Through i3 config (in case that no golang's default environment variables are overwritten):

```
bindsym $mod+period exec ~/go/bin/i3-extra-workspace toggle
bindsym $mod+shift+period exec ~/go/bin/i3-extra-workspace borrow-container
```

`toggle` to create and navigate to an extra workspace immediately and vice versa.

`borrow-container` to borrow (ok: move) a focused container to the extra workspace and vice versa. The extra workspace is created if there is none.

## Notes

- An extra workspace is non-navigable through a workspace number

- An extra workspace's name is generated by adding an underscore (`_`) to the name of "main" workspace
